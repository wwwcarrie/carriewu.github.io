### Chart A: 
```{r}
# Tidy dataset
rest_inspec_filtered <- rest_inspec |>
  # Select relevant columns for analysis
  select(dba, boro, cuisine_description, inspection_date, score, grade) |>
  # Filter to include only specific conditions
  filter(
    boro == "MANHATTAN",        # Filter for restaurants in Manhattan
  ) |>
  # Remove rows with missing grades or total score
  drop_na(boro, cuisine_description, inspection_date, score, grade)

# Create box plot to show score distribution for each cuisine type
rest_inspec |>
  filter(cuisine_description %in% c("American", "Chinese", "Japanese", "Mexican", "Caribbean"), !is.na(score)) |>  # select interest cuisine and drop NA
  mutate(cuisine_description = fct_reorder(cuisine_description, score)) |> #reorder based on median of score
  plot_ly(
    y = ~score,
    x = ~cuisine_description,
    color = ~cuisine_description,
    type = "box",
    colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Score Distribution by Selected Cuisines",
    xaxis = list(title = "Cuisine Type"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Inspection Score"),
        showlegend = FALSE
  )

#`rest_inspec_filtered` has 77338 observations and 6 variables (restaurant_name, borough, cuisine, inspection_date, violation_category, severity_points, total_score, grade, etc.)

#**Inspection score vs. cuisine type**

#The box plot shows that American and Japanese cuisines generally have lower median inspection scores, indicating fewer violations compared to Chinese, Caribbean, and Mexican cuisines. There is significant variability in the scores for all cuisines, with many outliers at higher scores, suggesting that some restaurants in each category have considerable issues with compliance.

### Chart B: 
```{r}
# Filter data to only include relevant grades
borough_grades <- rest_inspec |>
  filter(grade %in% c("A", "B", "C"), !is.na(boro)) |>  # Keep only rows with grades A, B, or C, and non-missing borough
  count(boro, grade)  # Count the number of occurrences for each combination of borough and grade

# Create a bar plot of grades by borough
plot_ly(
  data = borough_grades,
  x = ~boro,
  y = ~n,
  color = ~grade,
  type = "bar",
  colors = "viridis"
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Number of A, B, C Grades by Borough",
    xaxis = list(title = "Borough"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Restaurants"),
    barmode = "group",  # Use group mode to display bars side by side
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Grades"),
    legend = list(title = list(text = "Grade"))
  )


# `borough_grades` has 16 observations and 3 variables (boro, grade, n)

#**Borough vs. Grade**

#The bar plot shows that Manhattan has the highest number of restaurants with grades A, B, and C, followed by Brooklyn and Queens. The vast majority of restaurants in all boroughs have an A. 
```

### Chart C: 

```{r}
# Prepare the data to analyze seasonality by month
monthly_scores <- rest_inspec |>
  filter(!is.na(inspection_date), !is.na(score)) |>  # Remove rows with missing dates or scores
  mutate(month = month(inspection_date, label = TRUE)) |>  # Extract the month from the inspection date
  group_by(month) |>  # Group by month
  summarize(avg_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) |>  # Calculate the average score for each month
  ungroup()

# Create a line plot of average inspection scores by month
plot_ly(
  data = monthly_scores,
  x = ~month,
  y = ~avg_score,
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'lines+markers',
  line = list(shape = "linear"),
  marker = list(size = 8),
  colors = "viridis"
) |>
  layout(
    title = "Average Inspection Score by Month",
    xaxis = list(title = "Month"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Average Inspection Score"),
    showlegend = FALSE
  )

# `monthly score` has 12 observations (month) and 2 variables (month and average score)

#**Average inspection score vs. month**

#The line plot shows that average inspection scores are generally higher during the summer months (June to September), indicating more health code violations. Scores tend to decrease significantly in the winter months, suggesting better compliance during that time.
